# Movie Recommender System

A content-based movie recommendation engine built with Python and Streamlit. This application suggests similar movies based on a user's selection, leveraging machine learning to analyze movie features.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This project uses a **Content-Based Filtering** approach. The recommendation algorithm doesn't rely on user ratings but rather on the intrinsic properties of the movies themselves.

1.  **Data Collection:** The system uses the [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv) from Kaggle.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Key features are extracted from the dataset for each movie, including **genres, keywords, cast, and crew (director)**.
3.  **Feature Engineering:** These text-based features are combined into a single text block, or "tag," for each movie. This creates a concise profile of the movie's content.
4.  **Vectorization:** The text tags are converted into numerical vectors using the **`CountVectorizer`** from Scikit-learn. Each movie is now represented as a vector in a high-dimensional space.
5.  **Similarity Calculation:** The **Cosine Similarity** metric is used to calculate the similarity between the vectors of every movie pair. A higher cosine similarity score means the movies are more alike in content.
6.  **Recommendation:** When a user selects a movie, the system finds its vector, retrieves its pre-computed similarity scores with all other movies, sorts them, and returns the top 5 most similar movies.
